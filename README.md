# January 17: Introductions

This week is about getting to know the course. We'll cover the syllabus and spend a bit of time getting to know everyone. We'll talk about Wang's take on careers in the field. Then we'll dive into a wild exercise: solving the classic Monty Hall problem using our own simulation in R. I'll save some time at the end to troubleshoot the installation of R and RStudio for anyone who hasn't completed it.

## Preparation
- Glance through Annie Wang's indispensable [guide to careers in data analytics](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/).
- Install R and RStudio. See Chapters 2 and 3 of my [R Survival Guide](https://austin-hart-pols.github.io/SurvivalGuide/) for instructions if you haven't already installed it.
- Install our most commonly-used packages for this semester:
  - `tidyverse` suite of packages (`install.packages('tidyverse')`)
  - `rmarkdown` 
  - `knitr`
  - `tinytex`
  - `patchwork`

## Class materials
- [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/107wQ9VhKJ_ASmzD4RSGRogpCYiXa2eLW-Ewy8LM9UH4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [The Monty Hall problem](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/01-Intro/tree/main/MontyHall) exercise

## Tips for building your R skills:
Work through the sample exercises in the Survival Guide or Chapters 2 or 5 of [Dr. Bryanâ€™s Stat 545 text](https://stat545.com/). Get used to typing and executing commands, loading packages, setting a directory, etc. Compare your output with that given in the texts.

## Assessments
- Submit your draft Analyst Resume in hard copy on January 24. Be sure to include a section highlighting your computing, stats, and or analysis skills.
- Extra Credit: create a [github](https://github.com) account. Email me with your username.
